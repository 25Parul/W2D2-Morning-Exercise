        Dolphins are highly intelligent and social marine mammals that are known for their playful behavior and acrobatic skills. They are found in oceans and seas all over the world, and are closely related to whales and porpoises. Dolphins have a streamlined body, a curved dorsal fin, and a beak-like snout. They are carnivorous and feed on a variety of fish and squid. Dolphins are known for their ability to communicate with each other through a series of clicks, whistles, and body language. They are also very social animals and often swim together in groups called pods. Dolphins are popular among humans for their friendly and curious nature.
